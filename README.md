# RESRVD




# RESRVD is a reservation site that lets you make calendars for different jobs or events.
# We hope to be able to make a safe, easy-to-use cloud web service that allows admins to manage user input while still allowing users the freedom to access the servers at any time.
# We will be using SQL, react.js, and typescript mainly for this project.
# We also hope to break development down into 3 testing phases, the user input phase, the admin phase, and open access.
